Queue using Linked List
1. Queue is first in first out Data structure
2. if we have functionality in data structure where we can insert at last &
removed from front then we can implement queue behaviour.
3. so if we implement function add_at_last & remove_from_front using linked list
then we can implement Queue.





Stack Using Linked List
1. Stack is First in Last out Data structure.
2. if we have functionality where we can insert from one end and also delete element
from that end.
3. then we can have behaviour as Stack.
4. so if we implement function add_at_head & remove_from_front then we can implement
Stack Data structure using Linked List.
